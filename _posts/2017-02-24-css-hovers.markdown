# Some CSS hover effects. 
I used in in some my works for hover to images.
In this work I used pure CSS.
### This is the part of code:
```
.blur, .overlay {
	display: inline-block;
	width: 230px;
	height: 150px;
	margin-right: 10px;
	overflow:hidden;
	position: relative;
	z-index:2;
}
```
Full result you can [See here](/css_js/hover_effects/index.html)
