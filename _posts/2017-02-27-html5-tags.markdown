# HTML5
Today we consider a HTML5 tags and how it uses correctly.
What is it HTML5 tags? How to write code semantically?
Ready?

Let'go!

## HTML5 tags
HTML5 tags allow us to write more semantical and correct code.
For example in HTML4:
```
<div class="header">
</div>
or
<div class="main">
</div>
or
<div class="footer">
</div>
```
Semanticaly? Maybe. But just not quite right.
Imagine that we forgot to put the class ```class="main"``` or someone will help us develop our site and made some fixes, 2 months have passed, we add more and more code to our very big site.
And once on one page we see the code:
```
<div>
	<p class="important__text"></p>
</div>
``` 
And we can not understand this is post or this is main contant or what is it at all.
If we had used HTML5 tags, we would see something like this:
```
 <main>
	<p class="important__text"></p>
</main>
```
As for me it is more clearer.
Ok. Go ahead.

## The most interesting tags
The most interesting new HTML5 elements are: 
1. New semantic elements like ```<header>, <footer>, <article>, and <section>```.
2. New attributes of form elements like email, month, color, date.
3. New graphic elements: ```<svg> and <canvas>```.
4. New multimedia elements: ```<audio> and <video>```.

More tags and more inforamtion about HTML5 tags we can see here [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp)
### How we can use this tags?
 Remember: 
1. instead of using ```<div class="header"></div>``` - we always use ```<header></header>```
2. instead of using ```<div class="footer"></div>``` - we always use ```<footer></footer>```
3. instead of using ```<div class="left-sidebar"></div>``` - we always use ```<aside></aside>```
4. if we have a lot of tags or group ```<h1> or <h2> or <h3>``` - we always use ```<hgroup></hgroup>```
  
Something like this:
```
<hgroup>
  <h1>Welcome to my super site!</h1>
  <h2>For all cool programmers!</h2>
</hgroup>
```
  More? Ok. 

If we use a ```<img>``` - we can use it in ```<figure>```.

Like this:
```
<figure>
  <img src="img.jpg" alt="Cool me" width="304" height="228">
</figure>
```
If we use a form elements - we always use right type for them.

Instead of ```<input type="text" placeholder="Number">``` we always use ```<input type="number" value="Number">```
## How to remember it ?
Our salvation is this two sites (for a start) [htmlreference](http://htmlreference.io) and [html5accessibility.com](http://html5accessibility.com/html5elements/)
First link a full reference book in all HTML tags including HTML5 tags and exaples how to use them.
Second link a site where is all HTML5 tags are using semantic and correctly.

If you learned it all but confuse where to use ```<article>``` and where ```<section>``` - here [bitsofco.de](https://bitsofco.de/sectioning-content-in-html5/) is post where examines the correct usage this tags.

Ok. I think it will be useful to you. Thank you.
