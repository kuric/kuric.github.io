# Sublime text tutor

Hello. 
When I write html and css I usually use a Sublime Text editor.
It is very simple, easy and fast text editor, but not only this.
For faster coding we can use a lot of plugins, like a [Emmet](http://emmet.io/).
But not all developers are aware of the capabilities of the built-in editor. 
In this short post we look at some possibilities of this beautiful text editor.
Ok. Let's go!
<!--more-->
## Hotkeys

In the text editor used many Hotkeys for simplier adding or editing text.
For example
```
Goto Anything (`Ctrl + P`)
```
or
``` 
Insert line before - `Ctrl + Shift + Return`
Insert line after - `Ctrl + Return`
```
It's a simple hotkeys, but this editor has a more hotkeys that look great for developer.
For example
```
Sorting lines - F9
```
or
```
Case sensitive sorting of linesk - `Ctrl + F9`
```
How we use it?
Ok, we have an list with some text.
```
6. This is line number six
1. This is line number one
6. This is line number six
5. This is line number five
4. This is line number four
3. This is line number three
2. This is line number two
2. This is line number two
3. This is line number three
```
If we going to sort this manually we spend more time. 
And if we have a list of 1000 items? Hours? 1 000 000 ? Days?
In Sublime Text we can push only - F9 an we get result:
```
1. This is line number one
2. This is line number two
2. This is line number two
3. This is line number three
3. This is line number three
4. This is line number four
5. This is line number five
6. This is line number six
6. This is line number six
```
Great? Yeah)
Another example. 
We have an simle HTML code:
```
<div>
<ul>
  <li> First list item</li>
  <li> Second list item</li>
  <li> Third list item</li>
</ul>
```
How we cand add a closing tags for li? Manually? Ok, but we have a usefull Hotkey. 
Press `Alt + .` and we get a closing tags.
```
<div>
<ul>
  <li> First list item</li>
  <li> Second list item</li>
  <li> Third list item</li>
</ul>
```
## Where we can see all hotkeys?
We can choose to see all the hotkeys on there [Sublime](https://www.cheatography.com/tdeyle/cheat-sheets/sublime-text-3/) or
we can receive training here [Sublime Tutor](https://sublimetutor.com/)

## What is Sublime Tutor?
Sublime Tutor is a simple Sublime Text 3 plugin which allows you to explore all the commands and Hotkeys.
It's a better than cheat-sheets, faster and more usefull.
I am advise to you this tutorial.
