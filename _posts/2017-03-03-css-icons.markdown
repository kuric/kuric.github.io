# CSS Icons

Hello. When I was looking how to add different icons on the next project, I found on the Internet site [http://cssicon.space/#/icon/arrow-up](http://cssicon.space/#/icon/arrow-up)
In this site we can see more examples of icons (like a Fontawesome or Bootstrap) in pure CSS.

## What icon is on this site?
Want arrow icons for your buttons? Yes, there is.
For example: 
```
.arrow-up.icon:before {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  left: -5px;
  top: 1px;
  width: 10px;
  height: 10px;
  border-top: solid 1px currentColor;
  border-right: solid 1px currentColor;
  -webkit-transform: rotate(-45deg);
          transform: rotate(-45deg);
}
```
 Want smilling icons ? Yes, there is too
 ```
 .laugh-solid.icon {
  color: #000;
  position: absolute;
  margin-left: 2px;
  margin-top: 2px;
  width: 16px;
  height: 16px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  border: solid 1px currentColor;
  background-color: currentColor;
}
```
There is more than 500 icons!
## Why is it necessary?
Why is it necessary if we can add Fontawesome or Bootstrap or something more?
This is pure CSS. This is faster, we do not need to connect the library and and just very cool!
Also, it's just a super source for beginners to see how and what can be done in pure CSS.
