## How to use Hover.css
1. Download a library from  here [Hover.css](https://github.com/IanLunn/Hover)
2. Add to you site
3. Make a your hover effect more better

If you want to work with LESS or SASS we can use this:
```
Properties can be prefixed like so:

Sass:
@include prefixed(transition-duration, .3s);
LESS:
.prefixed(transition-duration, .3s);
```
If we works with NPM or Bower - we can add this library to our project with simple command:
```
npm install --save hover.css
```
Bower:
``` 
bower install Hover
```
## What we can do with Hover.css ?
Let's take a closer look at what we can do.
You can add to your site more effects, like a 2D Transitions, Background Transitions, Icons Transitions, Border Transitions and more and more and more by adding only one library and simple add class.
All works with this library Ñˆis based on adding '.hrv-' classes to your element.

For example:
```
<a href="#" class="button hvr-float">Float me!</a>
```
Now, when you hover over the button, we get a float effect!

## What is main benefits of the library?
Ok, this is very simple. Main benefit - it's a CSS :)
This is faster than JS, more readable and very simple to use even for beginners.


I think it will be useful to you. Thank you and thank to [Ian Lunn](https://github.com/IanLunn)
