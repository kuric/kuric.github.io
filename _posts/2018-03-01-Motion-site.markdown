## This site was develop for practice. 
In this project I used flex, smart-grid, Less, Jquery, JS and etc..
In the project I used optimized template (only PUG, only Less) and build that in Gulp.
Using a template was a very simple, very fast and I got a lot of experience experience when using PUG and working with GULP.
## Result : simple and fast landing page without frameworks.
